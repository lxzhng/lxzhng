CS + Philosophy student at the University of Illinois!

I'm more interested in the philosophical aspects of computer science rather than its practical applications. In high school, I found myself reading a lot about the philosophy of math, analytic philosophy, and physics, and somehow didn't realize that these were all related at the heart of computer science.

That's all for now!

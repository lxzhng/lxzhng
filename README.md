CS + Philosophy student at the University of Illinois!

I'm more interested in the philosophical aspects of computer science rather than its practical applications. In high school, I found myself reading a lot about the philosophy of math, analytic philosophy, and physics, and somehow didn't realize that these were all connected in the foundations of computer science.

Philosophically, I side with early Wittgenstein in claiming that most philosophy is bogus. 

Computer-scientifically, I'm a fan of Apple. I like Swift, I like their design-oriented and first-principles approach to things, and I think they have a cool vision of the future. Unlike the other big tech companies.

I'm not looking for a job right now or anything. I'm on GitHub because it's basically social media for programmers.

That's all for now!
